## Purpose/ Game Overview

The goal of the game is to work your way from novice to Bar Manager by passing three levels of mixology challenges that test your knowledge on increasingly diffucult drinks. As the you progress through the levels, the complexity of the drinks increase and proportional measurements come into play. In the final level, your patrons will use flavor descriptors to tell you what type of drink they are in the mood for and you must choose off the cocktail menu the most appropriate option, as well as make it correctly. If you pass all 3 levels, you win the game.

### Details

At the start of the game, the user will see a bar of ingredients. When the user clicks start, a glass will show up in front of them with a name of a drink and a timer of 30 seconds will be initiated. The glass will show compartmental placeholders, indicating to the user how many ingredients the drink contains. If the timer runs out, the player loses. When the user hits submit drink button, the drink will be checked for proper ingredients. If the drink is wrong, player loses,if drink is correct, there will be a new glass placed, to 3 glasses per level (each drink of increasing complexity). When all glasses are filled accurately, the user will move on to level 2. In this level, user will once again need to choose the right ingredients, but this time, they must also accurately increment the Oz of each ingredient (by .5 oz, _we will consider "a splash" as .5oz_) to the appropriate proportion.
